# Sim-LearnHeuristic
Create the sim-learnheuristic method in Julia, that combines a multi-start (MS) metaheuristic framework, Monte Carlo simulation (MCS), and a Logistic Regression model. This methodology aims to combine the advantages of all elements, enabling effi- cient exploration of the search space for optimal solutions.
